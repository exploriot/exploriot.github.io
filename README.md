## Setting up a server.

### Repl.it

- Enter https://replit.com/
- Press the `+` button on the right top corner.
- Press `Import from GitHub` on the `Create a Repl` popup.
- Press `From URL`.
- Enter `exploriot/exploriot.github.io` in the `Github Repository URL` input.
- Press `Import from GitHub`.
- Press `Run` on top of the screen.
- Viola! Now the server and the client should be up and running!
- You can now click the `New tab` button on the `Webview` section on the right which will take you to the client.
- Copy the url and keep it for now.
- Now anyone on the globe can either use that client or use [the official client](https://exploriot.github.io/).
- In the IP place put the url you got from the `Webview`. And for port, simply put `80`.

To run commands, simply open the repl.it page and get to the `Console` tab and type the command you want, and press
enter.

### Locally

- Install the repository by **Code > Download ZIP**, or via `git clone https://github.com/exploriot/exploriot.github.io`
- Run `npm run server` to start the server.
- For the IP and port, you will have to use your own IP and port.
- But if you want to join it, you can simply type `127.0.0.1` for the port, but this will only work for you.
